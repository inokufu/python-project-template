## 🔧 Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Create a new project

To create a new Python project from this template:

```bash
# Generate a new project
copier copy gh:inokufu/python-project-template path/to/destination

# Navigate to the project
cd path/to/destination

# Init GIT (if you haven't already done)
git init

# Initialize the project
make init
```

That's it! Feel free to focus on the coding within `src` and `tests` folders !

### Update an existing project

One of the advantages of Copier is the ability to update existing projects when
the template is improved:

```bash
# Update your project with the latest template version
cd path/to/your/project
copier update
```

This will update your project files while preserving your source code and tests.
